# Contributing guide

Want to contribute? Great!

We try to make it easy, and all contributions, even the smaller ones, are more than welcome.
This includes bug reports, fixes, documentation, examples...

If you are looking for an issue to work on and haven't had much previous experience with Narayana LRA then you could choose one that has the label [good-first-issue](https://github.com/jbosstm/lra/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22). For Hacktoberfest we have created a zulip stream called [hacktoberfest](https://narayana.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/406889-hacktoberfest/topic/stream.20events/near/393204842) for discussions. If you want to take an issue then ping a team member (or add a message to the zulip stream) and we will update the assignee field.

On the other hand, if you are set to tackle a big, complicated issue or an issue that will have a high impact on the code base, it is highly recommended to follow the [Request for enhancement (RFE) [workflow](https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana-proposals/blob/main/README.md). Choosing to employ this workflow before starting the development of the selected RFE will help the Narayana core team and yourself to clarify the requirements, the constraints, and the overall design to tackle the issue in advance. In other words, employing the RFE workflow will make sure that the Narayana core team and yourself are on the same page before starting coding.

But first, read this page.

We use a four step process for contributions:

1. Fork the project repository to your own GitHub account.
1. Make your changes.
1. Build the project (`./mvnw clean package -DskipTests`) to apply the formatting rules.
1. Commit your changes to your fork.
1. Create a GitHub Pull Request for your change, following the instructions in the pull request template.
1. Perform a Code Review with the project maintainers on the pull request.

## Certificate of Origin and License

All files in this repository are subject to the Apache 2.0 license.

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

There are copies of the [license](LICENSE) and [DCO](dco.txt) in the root directory of this repository.

New files MUST include the project SPDX License Identifier (Apache-2.0), for example Java files would include:

```
/*

   SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 */
```

Please use comment characters appropriate to the file you are creating. We also ask contributors *not* to include `@author` tags.

Although copyright notices on contributions are not strictly necessary we do ask contributors to include the above text; code authors still receive attribution for their contribution via the information contained in the git commit metadata.

## Reporting an issue

If you believe you found a bug (and all software has bugs) we'll need to know how to reproduce it, what you are seeing and what you would expect to see.
To report the issue use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jbosstm/lra/issues). 

## Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to eradicating problematic language in all of our interactions, including code, documentation, web properties, etc (https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language). Although the Narayana project has no plans to retrospectively update its materials we do ask that all contributors be cognizant of the language they use in all communications related to Narayana.

### Building main

See the [README](README.md) file in the root directory of the repository.

## Before you contribute

### Guidelines

We follow [Open source participation guidelines](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/open-source-participation-guidelines-overview).

We expect all contributors and users to follow our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when communicating through project channels. These include, but are not limited to: chat, issues, code.

#### Coding Guidelines

We use the maven `checkstyle` and `sortpom` plugins which are enabled by default and skipped in certain cases for older modules.

For older modules where checkstyle is disabled, when editing a file you should either:

1. follow the style currently used in the file you have edited or,
1. reformat it according to our checkstyle ruleset (by temporarily enabling checkstyle on the affected module) but separate functional changes from formatting changes into different commits in the same PR (this rule facilitates traceability). In other words, a file (in a module with checkstyle disabled) may only be re-formatted if it also contains a functional change and is made in a separate commit.

> [!NOTE]
> To scan a single file using Narayana's checkstyle rules in a maven module where checkstyle is not enabled, run the following command from the root directory of the maven module containing the file:
> ```
> mvn checkstyle:check -Dcheckstyle.includes="path/to/the/file/from/package/root/filename.java" -Dcheckstyle.skip=false
> ```
> For example, to scan the file `ArjunaJTA/jta/classes/com/arjuna/ats/internal/jta/resources/arjunacore/CommitMarkableResourceRecord.java` with Narayana's checkstyle rules, the following command should be executed from `ArjunaJTA/jta`:
> ```
> mvn checkstyle:check -Dcheckstyle.includes=com/arjuna/ats/internal/jta/resources/arjunacore/CommitMarkableResourceRecord.java -Dcheckstyle.skip=false
> ```

In general, most IDEs allow you to configure a rule file from your IDE settings (for Intelij that would be Settings -> Other Settings -> Checkstyle). The rule file is located in the [narayana-checkstyle repo](https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana-checkstyle-config/tree/main/src/main/resources/narayana-checkstyle).

We do not use `@author` tags in the Javadoc in new code: they are hard to maintain, especially in a very active project, and we use the Git history to track authorship, however GitHub provides [this nice page with your contributions](https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/graphs/contributors).

Commits should be atomic and semantic. Commits should be squashed before submitting the PR unless the commits are necessary to track different parts of a fix or to separate out formatting only changes from functional changes. Fixup commits can be used temporarily during the review process, to help the reviewer navigate your changeset, but these should be squashed before merging the PR (in order to provide the software with a more meaningful commit history).

To contribute, use GitHub Pull Requests (PRs), from your **own** fork.

When you create a PR, the description field of the PR will include brief instructions on what you need to include.
But the following guidelines provide a more detailed set of requirements that we have found useful:

1. The Pull Request *should* contain a link to the GitHub issue(s) at the start of the PR description (only minor changes to script/text files are exempt from this rule). If the engineer wishes to address multiple issues and they are closely related then they can be addressed in a single PR. The GitHub issue must contain sufficient information to enable the reader to understand what the issue is, so at a minimum the description field of the GitHub issue must be present and legible/clear.
2. If the Pull Request depends on other pull requests, please put the full URL of the pull request(s) that you depend on. Ideally with a prefix "Depends on ".
3. The engineer raising the PR should have tested their changes prior to submitting the request to merge changes. However, there are some circumstances where this may not be possible in which case you must add the label "Hold" and update the PR description indicating why it isn't ready for review just yet. The policy to add the label "Hold" is a signal to reviewers that the changes are not yet ready to be reviewed.

Also, make sure you have set up your Git authorship correctly:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```

If you use different computers to contribute, please make sure the name is the same on all your computers.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, should be reviewed before being merged.
A possible exception is that if a change only effects build scripts or non-source files and is "small" then self review is permitted. But use this option with care to avoid breaking build scripts or the readabilty of text files.

Before asking for a review it's best to wait for [Continuous Integration tests](#continuous-integration) to finish successfully (unless early feedback is being sought).

Once a review has started both parties should attempt to respond to feedback in a timely manner.
Do not approve the PR until you have either seen a successful GitHub action test of the PR, or you can reasonably explain why a failure is unrelated to the code changes made in the PR (and documented in a PR comment).

#### What can I expect in a code review?

The review procedure is that the reviewer:
* Adds comments to the code if they have any remarks about it - remarks should not be a reason for not providing an approval.
* Requests changes on the pull request if the pull request contravenes a project expectation - in this case the reviewer should look to cite criteria

These criteria may be:
* Not specifically addressing the issue being fixed
* Clean up changes not being in a separate git commit

The person that raised the PR then responds by either:
* Agreeing - in which case they add the change to their local repo and push to their own github fork of it - this will update the PR
* Disagreeing - Adding a comment on why they think the review comment is invalid.

If the person raising the PR disagrees with the review comment then he/she should respond to the comment saying why they disagree.

Once all disagreements have been resolved and any changes after review have been pushed and retested then the PR may be merged.

### Continuous Integration

To ensure Narayana is stable for everyone, all changes should go through Narayana LRA continuous integration: when you raise a pull request a GitHub action will test your PR.

### Tests and documentation are not optional

Don't forget to include tests in your pull requests.
Also don't forget the documentation (reference documentation for features, javadoc...).

## Update the issue when the PR is closed:

If the change would result in behaviour in Narayana LRA that is incompatible with the current release stream for Narayana LRA, then please specify it in the issue description.

When the GitHub Pull Request has passed all relevant GitHub action checks and has been approved by a reviewer the code can be merged. If you don't have permission to do this then ping one of the team who will then merge it. Once merged the issue must be updated in the issue tracker (if you don't have permission then a team member will do this):

1. Press the `Close issue` (usually it is `Close as completed`))


## Release

The Narayana LRA project applies the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) 2.0.0 to mark its releases.
