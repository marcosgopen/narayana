= `lra/test` module - integration tests

This module has been designed to simulate an environment with three actors: the LRA coordinator, the LRA participant,
and a client (which in this case is the test class). This is implemented using three JVMs running separately.
This reproduces a production scenario where the LRA coordinator runs independently from the LRA participant(s)
and from the client(s).
All tests are executed with help of https://arquillian.org[Arquillian] platform. In some tests, Arquillian is coupled
with maven plugin to start the runtime and deploy the LRA coordinator.

The `lra/test` module contains the following submodules

* link:./arquillian-extension/[`arquillian-extension`] contains Arquillian extension classes
  which make possible to execute the test modules on supported runtimes
* link:./basic[`basic`] contains integration tests which are written for testing
  the Narayana features of the
  https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra[LRA specification]
* link:./tck[`tck`] is a module which is responsible for the execution of
  https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/tree/master/tck[LRA TCK tests]
  with Narayana supported runtimes
* link:./crash[`crash`] hosts tests that simulate a crash of either the LRA coordinator or
  the LRA participant or both. So far, only Wildfly is considered in this module as Quarkus
  does not have an Arquillian adapter to run unmanaged tests

== How to run integration tests

Integration tests are tested with
https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/[Maven Failsafe Plugin], using the target 'verify'.

Single test can be executed with `-Dit.test=...`
To use Failsafe in debug mode, use `-Dmaven.failsafe.debug`

The Failsafe Plugin link:../pom.xml[is configured] to run tests with names
`*IT.java`, `*Tests.java` and `*TestCase.java`.

=== Application runtimes

The module is configured to run with https://www.wildfly.org[WildFly] application runtime.

The **WildFly** runtime is used through the 'arq' profile. Two instances of Wildfly are initiated:
 * The first instance is started using WildFly Maven Plugin to deploy the LRA
   coordinator using the WAR produced by the module `lra/lra-coordinator-war`.
   If you specify `-Pcoordinator.wildfly.subsystem` profile, then the tests use
   the LRA coordinator provided by WildFly subsystem (which might be out of sync
   with the current project changes).
 * The second instance is started using Arquillian to deploy the LRA participant
   under test. Moreover, the testing class is hosted on separated JVM.

=== Running tests with WildFly

To start all integration tests, testing with the coordinator that was build by the module `lra/lra-coordinator-war`:

[source,sh]
----
export JBOSS_HOME=<path-to-wildfly-distribution-directory>
mvn clean verify -Parq

# single test in one module
mvn clean verify -Parq -pl :lra-test-basic -Dit.test=FailedLRAIT
----

To start all integration tests, testing with the build-in coordinator of WildFly:

[source,sh]
----
export JBOSS_HOME=<path-to-wildfly-distribution-directory>
mvn clean verify -Parq,coordinator.wildfly.subsystem

# single test in one module
mvn clean verify -Parq,coordinator.wildfly.subsystem -pl :lra-test-basic -Dit.test=FailedLRAIT#testWithStatusCompensateFailed
----
